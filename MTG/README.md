Welcome to your MTG Card Program.

This program has 2 primary functions as explained below:

    ~Card Entry- This is where you will enter your cards and
        they will be saved to a file so the program can use
        the data for later functions.
    ~Card Search- This is where you're able to enter criteria
        and the program searches through your saved cards
        returning a scrollable window so you can view the
        results.
    ~Help- Opens a short help menu.
